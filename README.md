# Discrete Event Simulation of EAU Follow-up Algorithm

This repository details the underpinning data and R code used to model the European Association of Urology Follow-up Algorithm (see below). <br>

The model examines multiple theoretical diagnostic accuracy thresholds for prediction of recurrence, as well as modelling differing types of imaging modality and lengths of follow-up. <br>

Each script for the model is in order, and those wishing to replicate the model should run each in order. <br>
