# Discrete Event Simulation of EAU Follow-up Algorithm

This repository details the underpinning data and R code used to model the European Association of Urology Follow-up Algorithm (see below). <br>

The model examines multiple theoretical diagnostic accuracy thresholds for prediction of recurrence, as well as modelling differing types of imaging modality and lengths of follow-up. <br>

Each script for the model is in order, and those wishing to replicate the model should run each in order. <br>

There are two models - both labelled no. 4: <br>
1. Normal distribution for scores - e.g. blood test result <br>
2. Beta distribution for score - e.g. prognostic model output <br>
<br>
